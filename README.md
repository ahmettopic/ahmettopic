### Before you read!
Thanks for visiting my Portfolio and I hope you enjoyed it. As you've noticed there is much work left to do and I'm sorry if it spoiled your experience!

### Goals and Background
The goal with this kind of project is to evolve myself to become a better webdeveloper, webdesigner and to tie my skills together. The idea behind this whole project was to create a resume/portfolio ultimately, I am a webdeveloper so it's the right way.

## Upcoming plans

### SnackBar
The **SnackBar** should be able to be toggled.

### AppBar
The **AppBar** needs some UI changes, both *desktop* and *mobile* view. The plan is to create a more "friendly" experience. When in *mobile* view the **AppBar** should be placed at bottom of screen so that it's always reachable.

### Dashboard
- [x] Add Login btn in the **AppBar** so that **Admin** can Login and navigate to /dashboard.
- [x] SignIn and Logout using Google Firebase.
- [x] Add, Remove and Edit **Portfolio** items from Google Firebase.

### Skills
The **Skills** needs some position fixes.

### Portfolio
Show all of my projects and link to GitHub profile.

- [x] Fetch data from Firebase.

### Contact
When in **Contact** the user will be able to send me a message/email. Create some kind of Login/Auth before sending message/email.

### Image
The profile picture needs to be converted to SVG

### Layout
Overall changes in UI/UX
