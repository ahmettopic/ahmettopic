#### Before you read!
Thanks for visiting my Portfolio, I hope you enjoyed it. As you noticed there is much work left to do and I'm sorry if it spoiled your experience!

#### Goals and Background
The **goal** with this kind of project is to evolve myself to become a better webdeveloper, webdesigner and to tie my skills together. The idea behind this whole project was to create a resume/portfolio ultimately, I am a webdeveloper so it's the right way.

#### Upcoming plans

##### SnackBar
The <SnackBar/> should be able to be toggled.

##### AppBar
The <AppBar/> needs some UI changes, both **desktop** and **mobile** view. The plan is to create a more "friendly" experience. When in **mobile** view the <AppBar> should be placed at bottom of screen so that it's always reachable.

##### Skills
The <Skills/> needs some position fixes.

##### Portfolio
<Portfolio/> will show projects and links to repos.

##### Contact
When in <Contact/> the user will be able to send me a message/email

##### Image
The profile picture needs to be converted to SVG

##### Layout
Overall changes in UI/UX
